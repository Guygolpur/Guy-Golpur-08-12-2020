There are two users that can be used to connect to the system and perform actions:


sender@gmail.com


receiver@gmail.com
   
 Once logged in, the following actions will be possible:
 
 
       Sending an email message,
       
       
       Read incoming and outgoing e-mail,
       
       
       Delete incoming and outgoing e-mail,
       
       
       Switching between users (disconnecting via the power button in the Navbar)



 The e-mail interface should be performed between the two users mentioned above.



 It is clarified that at this stage sending and receiving e-mail will only be possible between the e-mail addresses mentioned above.
